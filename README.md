download src and put in project

LATEST UPDATE:
1. new preDateException 
blocked date before today can apply to new task.
2. list all task crash
fixed crashing if user input other value exp. 1-9
3. function rework
previous version function for senior and junior and manager is mixed. Now should be correct.
